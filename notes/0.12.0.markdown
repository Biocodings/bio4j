This release fixes a bug in parsing NCBITaxonomy data. The current distributions don't have information about taxonomic (scientific-) names.
Here are the changes in the NCBITaxonomy schema:

* Removed `scientificName` property; writing real scientific name to the `name` property instead (it was always empty before)
* Removed `comment` property; it wasn't used anywhere
